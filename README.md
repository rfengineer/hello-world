# hello-world
Welcome to all who wish to examine me - the rest of you can go back to sleep

This is my first real attempt at using git-hub for anything other than downloading software others have scribbled. 

According to the github 'tutorial', "Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others."  Well, that is what THIS README is all about. I'm going to discuss things with others here. 

First an intro:
My name is Ray Dall. I've been tinkering with computers since I built my first cosmac elf in the 70's. My primary occupation is as a Field Service Engineer, primarily involved in Radio Frequency equipment.  I've worked in the Consumer, Military and Broadcast industries, on Terrestrial, Microwave and Satellite systems. Yes I can fix your CB or Fuzzbuster.  No I'm not going to waste my time on it. 

I'm starting to get older, which means my body will begin breaking down.  I won't be able to dive head long into an oil filled transformer to change out the diode stack much longer, and frankly - I'm tired of doing crap like that. 30 years of doing crap jobs is about enough. 

Having said that - I believe that everyone, regardless of age, weight, or physical or mental impediments is capable of being productive to society somehow.  I fit into the catagory of everyone. 

So as I now look into my "retirement years" I am seeking out tasks more suited to those of an aging man with my particular skillset. 

In the last 30 years, I've dealt with computer systems in the process of my job, often having to examine and re-write code that was either faulty, or simply not adequate for the needs our particular company was using it for. I've had to do so in COBOL, PASCAL, FORTRAN, BASIC, Python, Java, and more recently - C. 

I figure that as long as I have eyesight and can type, and my mind is still limber, I can code.  So coding is where I plan to go. 

I do not plan on giving up all I've worked for over the last 30+ years though - so I will continue living on my 10 acre ranch in Kaufman Texas. If you are wondering about the goat picture - that is Sampson. He was my first buck. I now have goats, chickens, and cattle running all over the place.  Don't plan to sell that and move to Silicon Valley at this late stage in the game.

I am very Linux fluent, can run races around other people in shell scripting, and am becoming more adept at C. I have, over the years, written proprietary software (aka: I can't share it here) that controls various devices via serial port, and have made that equipment accessable via the internet using HTML and .cgi files. 

So here - I guess what I am going to do is start logging some of my efforts to re-learn C (which has changed over the years since I originally learned it), and become more proficient (perhaps even professional?) at it. 

I will indeed make some attempt at a daily "blog", and even throw some code snippits out once in a while. 

Hope you've enjoyed reading this introduction to the world of a blabbering old man.
